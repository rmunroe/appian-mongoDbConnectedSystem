function.m_and.description=Performs a logical AND operation on an array of one or more expressions (e.g. expression1, expression2, etc.) and selects the documents that satisfy all the expressions in the array. The $and operator uses short-circuit evaluation. If the first expression (e.g. expression1) evaluates to false, MongoDB will not evaluate the remaining expressions.
function.m_and.param.queryExpressions.description=The list of expressions (often created with other M_* functions) you wish to evaluate against.
